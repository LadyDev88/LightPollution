# LightPollution
Practice program to measure light pollution in users area for stargazing purposes

I have a "setup.bat" file. To run this, double click it or run in the terminal "setup.bat", and it should set up the virtual environment. 

Run by typing 

streamlit run light_mapper.py 

in the terminal. It  won't work if you just hit "run" at the top.
